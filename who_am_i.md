# Who am I?

If you're working in the clinical genomics space in New Zealand, tell me who you are!

## Leah Kemp

Hello, I'm Leah Kemp. I'm a bioinformatician working at [ESR](https://www.esr.cri.nz) based in Wellington New Zealand. I get data and I analyse it, including whole human genomes for the [Genomics Aotearoa clinical genomics](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/our-work/completed-projects/clinical-genomics) project. I like tidy and efficient things probably because of underlying personality traits, therefore I'm always interested in ways to create and improve high quality and reproducable research using any tools/software that helps achieve that end goal. However, I'm human like everyone else, so I will at times blindly love a piece of software and vilify a perfectly reasonable software just because I dont like it, relatable?
