# Genomics Aotearoa clinical genomics

---

"Stuff" relating to the [Genomics Aotearoa clinical genomics](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/our-work/completed-projects/clinical-genomics) project. This repository is primarily from a bioinformatics perspective given I work in the bioinformatics component of this project. Much of the content included in this repository is simply a collection of notes, ideas, problems, challenges, solutions which may benefit others. It's probably going to be a work in progress and should not be taken as a final say in anything. I sound selfless, and yes I hope this material helps others, but I must confess that there is an additional a selfish motivation driving me to create this repository. I want to collaborate so we can work together to create *better* clinical genomics in New Zealand. Contribute your own notes, vent the brick walls you face, explain what you're doing in a clinical genomics, contribute your own notes, ask questions in the [discussions](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/clinical_genomics/discussions) section, open an issue in the [issues](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/clinical_genomics/issues) section, give your perspective on why this is all wrong and what you'd do instead or simply create a pull request to fix my grammer (come on, someone needs to catch this one!). Let's collaborate :)
